# (01) Letter Puzzle Maker

## Overview

This is a library for automatically generating small, highly dense puzzles resembling crosswords. The player receives a certain set of letters (which may include wildcards) and is asked to place the tiles into the blanks so that every row or column consisting of two or more letters is a valid word.

Only the most common words of length 2 to 5 are used in creating puzzles, but puzzles are not required to have unique solutions.
